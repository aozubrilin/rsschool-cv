### About me

I worked as a software developer for industrial ventilation systems using Siemens S7-1200 controllers.<br>
Now I am developing interfaces for Wientek operator panels. I decided to move into web development and become a Frontend Developer.<br>
I like the dynamic field of frontend development where there is always something new to learn.<br>
I am ready to learn and develop to become an expert in this field.<br>
